Absolutely. Here’s a **lean, implementation-agnostic PRD** your developer can run with. It captures scope, constraints, behaviors, and acceptance criteria—while leaving technical choices (libs, exact data modeling, batching, charts, etc.) up to them.

# StreamerPulse — MVP PRD (Developer-Choice Edition)

**Owner:** Qane Ahmed
**Date:** Oct 13, 2025
**Objective:** Ship a Twitch-only **real-time chat analytics** beta that a streamer can use during a live broadcast to see message rate, windowed sentiment, unique chatters, top tokens/emotes, and basic spike events. Raw chat retained 90 days; aggregates kept indefinitely. EU hosting.

## 1) Scope

**In-scope (MVP)**

* Platform: **Twitch** only.
* Auth: **Clerk** (Twitch as the only social login).
* Real-time ingestion of **public channel chat** (read-only).
* Dashboard: live KPIs, timeline, spike events, top tokens/emotes.
* Stream history & detail views with export (CSV/JSON) of aggregates.
* Storage: raw messages (90 days), window aggregates and spikes (no expiry).
* Region: EU hosting footprint (Vercel + Convex).

**Out of scope (MVP)**

* YouTube/Kick, DMs/whispers, chat write/mod actions.
* Post-stream AI summaries, clip suggestions.
* Teams/roles, agencies.
* Billing and marketing site.

**Definition of “Working Beta”**

* Streamer signs in with Twitch, connects their channel, starts a live session, sees live metrics updating ≤1.5s end-to-end, finishes stream, sees it listed with a detail view and exports.

## 2) Users & Tenancy

* **User type:** Streamer (single account holder).
* **Tenancy model:** One **Workspace** per streamer.
* **No roles/permissions** beyond the owner.
* **Single concurrent stream** per workspace in MVP.

## 3) Product Surfaces

**Onboarding**

* Sign in with Twitch → confirm channel → auto-create Workspace/Integration → land on Live Dashboard.

**Live Dashboard**

* Status: channel name, connection state, live session timer, start/stop listening.
* KPIs: message rate, sentiment (windowed average), unique chatters (rolling), top tokens/emotes (rolling).
* Timeline: message rate with sentiment overlay at a regular cadence.
* Events feed: spike detections with timestamp and strength.

**Stream History**

* Table: title (or date), start/end, duration, total messages, average sentiment, spike count.

**Stream Detail**

* Timeline visualization with spike markers.
* Panels: top tokens/emotes for the session, unique chatters, window scrubber.
* Exports: CSV (aggregates), JSON (aggregates + spikes).

**Settings**

* Workspace name.
* Region (read-only: EU).
* Retention (read-only: 90 days).
* Twitch integration: show channel; disconnect option.

## 4) Data & Retention (Conceptual)

**Core entities (conceptual, not schema)**

* **User:** Clerk identity linkage.
* **Workspace:** owned by User; EU region; retention days.
* **Integration:** Twitch channel mapping (id, login, display name).
* **Stream:** platform, title, status, started/ended timestamps.
* **Chat Message:** timestamp, author display, author stable hash, text, emotes, message id.
* **Aggregate Window:** window start/end, message count, unique authors, top tokens/emotes, sentiment score/label.
* **Spike Event:** time range, reason (e.g., volume/emote), strength score.
* **Settings:** workspace timezone, language, optional webhook placeholder (disabled in MVP).

**Retention**

* **Raw chat:** delete older than **90 days**.
* **Aggregates/spikes:** keep indefinitely.
* **Storage cap:** soft cap per stream (e.g., 200k raw messages) after which only aggregates are stored; UI should inform the user without breaking live analytics.

**Privacy defaults**

* Store **public display name** and a **stable hashed author ID** (salted per workspace) to enable counts while reducing coupling to PII.
* Provide basic data export/delete at workspace level when feasible.
* Light, practical privacy notice; no heavy GDPR program in MVP.

## 5) Real-Time Analytics Behavior

**Latency & cadence**

* Target end-to-end metric latency: **≤1.5s**.
* Developer selects batching strategy (e.g., 2–5s windows) and display cadence (e.g., 5s).

**Metrics (minimum)**

* **Message rate** (with a recent sparkline).
* **Sentiment**: window-level score (−1..+1) and label (pos/neu/neg), plus rolling average for display.
* **Unique chatters** over a rolling window.
* **Top tokens/emotes** over a rolling window.
* **Spike events** based on relative surges (z-score or equivalent), with throttling to avoid spam.

**Sentiment**

* English-only for MVP.
* Window-level, not per-message.
* Developer chooses model/service; cost/latency balanced.

**Spike detection**

* Relative to recent baseline; minimum duration and volume; throttled (e.g., no more than one spike per minute unless clearly distinct).
* Record timestamp range, reason, and a numeric strength.

## 6) Ingestion Approach

* Twitch **read-only** chat ingestion for the streamer’s channel.
* Developer may choose client-side (e.g., WebSocket/IRC in a worker) or a small server/worker process.
* If client-side, document dependency on the dashboard being open; plan for a headless worker in a future iteration.

## 7) Integrations & Auth

* **Auth:** Clerk with **Twitch social login only**.
* **Twitch scopes:** minimal read for channel identity and **chat:read**.
* **Keys/secrets:** managed via Vercel/Convex secure storage.

## 8) Performance, Reliability & Limits

* **Throughput target:** up to **100 msgs/sec** sustained per stream.
* **Graceful degradation:** if caps are reached or sentiment is temporarily unavailable, live metrics continue (message rate still updates).
* **Reconnects:** automatic retry/backoff on dropped connections.

## 9) Observability

* Track: connection status, ingestion latency, batch sizes, write latency, sentiment latency/error rate, dropped messages, storage-cap events.
* Minimal dashboards using hosted logging/metrics (developer’s choice).
* Error toasts in UI for user-visible failures; silent retries where appropriate.

## 10) Security

* Auth-gated app; all reads/writes scoped to the user’s workspace.
* Transport over HTTPS; sensible CORS/CSP.
* No privileged chat permissions; no write/mod actions.

## 11) Acceptance Criteria (Testable)

**Onboarding**

* Sign in with Twitch → channel recognized → workspace created → land on live dashboard.

**Live session**

* Start listening → connection shows “Connected”.
* KPIs update at the chosen cadence; sentiment changes when chat content is obviously positive/negative.
* Spike events appear during sudden message surges.

**Persistence**

* Stream appears in history with accurate duration and totals.
* Detail page shows timeline and spikes; exports produce well-formed CSV/JSON.

**Retention**

* Mechanism exists to purge raw messages older than 90 days while keeping aggregates.

**Resilience**

* Temporary disconnects auto-recover without duplicate windows or crashes.

**Limits**

* Optional cap behavior is surfaced to the user (non-blocking notice) and does not break analytics.

## 12) Developer-Choice Areas (intentionally unspecified)

* Exact **ingestion** method (client vs lightweight worker) and library.
* **Batch/window** size and display cadence (within latency goal).
* **Tokenization** and emote parsing technique.
* **Sentiment provider/model** and thresholds for label mapping.
* **Spike algorithm** specifics (z-score window, thresholds, throttling details).
* **Charting** library and visual style (stay within Tailwind/shadcn system).
* **File format details** for CSV/JSON exports.
* **Logging/metrics** provider.
* **Indexing strategy** and data access patterns in Convex.

## 13) Risks & Mitigations

* **Serverless + sockets:** If serverless isn’t a fit for persistent sockets, prefer client-side ingestion for MVP; plan a small always-on worker later.
* **Rate limits/API variance:** Keep the ingestion read-only and lightweight; backoff on errors.
* **Sentiment variability:** Use windowed sentiment and smoothing to avoid UI jitter; fallback gracefully if the model times out.
* **Storage growth:** Enforce raw-message caps and rely on aggregates for long sessions.

## 14) Delivery Milestones (suggested)

1. **Week 1:** Auth + onboarding + Twitch connection; basic live ingestion proof; skeleton UI.
2. **Week 2:** Windowing, KPIs, timeline chart, spike detection.
3. **Week 3:** Persistence, history & detail views, exports.
4. **Week 4:** Polishing, retention job, resilience tests, staging beta.

## 15) Glossary

* **Window:** A fixed short time slice (e.g., 2–5s) over which metrics are computed.
* **Aggregate:** Precomputed stats per window used for dashboards/exports.
* **Spike:** A flagged period where activity significantly exceeds recent baseline.

Awesome—here are the add-ons you asked for. They’re written to drop straight into your PRD (Developer-Choice Edition).

# User Goals (Streamer POV)

1. See what chat cares about **right now** without tabbing through 1,000 messages.
2. Know when a **hype spike** happens so I can react on stream.
3. Keep a lightweight **history** of streams to compare performance over time.
4. Understand overall **vibe/sentiment** at a glance (am I doing well or losing the room?).
5. Find **top emotes/keywords** to tailor future content.
6. **Export** useful data for editors or sponsors (no messy manual work).
7. Connect once, then have the tool “just work” during lives with **minimal setup**.
8. Avoid privacy headaches: store only what’s needed; be able to **delete** my data.

# Simple User Stories (Streamer POV)

## Onboarding & Setup

* As a streamer, I want to **sign in with Twitch** so I can connect my channel quickly.
* As a streamer, I want the app to **detect my channel** automatically so I don’t paste IDs.
* As a streamer, I want to **start/stop listening** with a single button so I can focus on streaming.

## Live Session

* As a streamer, I want to see **message rate** and **sentiment** update in near real time so I can adjust my pacing.
* As a streamer, I want to see **spike alerts** when chat suddenly surges so I can lean into the moment.
* As a streamer, I want to see **unique chatters** and **top emotes/keywords** so I understand who’s active and what’s trending.
* As a streamer, I want the dashboard to **reconnect automatically** if the chat connection drops so I don’t babysit it.

## History & Insights

* As a streamer, I want a **list of past streams** with high-level stats so I can quickly scan performance.
* As a streamer, I want a **timeline view** of a past stream with **spike markers** so I can find notable moments.
* As a streamer, I want to **export aggregates** (CSV/JSON) so my editor can work without access to my account.

## Settings & Data

* As a streamer, I want to **disconnect** my Twitch integration if I stop using the tool.
* As a streamer, I want my **raw chat** kept for **90 days** and then removed while keeping useful aggregates.
* As a streamer, I want my **display name** and viewers’ data handled minimally and safely so I can feel comfortable using the tool.

# Functional Requirements (MVP)

## 1. Authentication & Onboarding

1.1 The system **must** allow sign-in via **Twitch (Clerk)** only.
1.2 Upon first sign-in, the system **must** detect and store the streamer’s **channel identity** (id/login/display).
1.3 The system **must** create a **Workspace** owned by the signed-in streamer.
1.4 The system **must** land the user on the **Live Dashboard** after setup.

**Acceptance:** A new user signs in, sees their channel info, and reaches the live dashboard in ≤ 60 seconds without manual IDs.

## 2. Live Chat Ingestion

2.1 The system **must** ingest **public channel chat** in real time for the connected channel (read-only).
2.2 The system **must** provide a **Start/Stop Listening** control.
2.3 The system **must** handle **automatic reconnect** with backoff if the connection drops.
2.4 The system **must** support sustained throughput up to **100 msgs/sec** for one concurrent stream.

**Acceptance:** With the dashboard open, live chat messages appear reflected in metrics within ≤ 1.5s end-to-end.

## 3. Real-Time Analytics & UI

3.1 The dashboard **must** display at least these KPIs:

* **Message rate** (with short sparkline)
* **Sentiment** (window-level score/label with a rolling average)
* **Unique chatters** (rolling)
* **Top keywords/emotes** (rolling)

3.2 The dashboard **must** include a **timeline** with message rate and sentiment overlay at a regular cadence.
3.3 The system **must** detect and display **spike events** (reason + strength + timestamp).
3.4 The system **should** throttle spike notifications to avoid spam (no more than one per ~minute unless clearly distinct).
3.5 The UI **must** indicate **connection status** (connected/connecting/disconnected).

**Acceptance:** KPIs and timeline refresh on cadence; at least one simulated surge raises a spike with a visible marker/event.

## 4. Data Storage & Retention

4.1 The system **must** persist:

* **Raw messages** (timestamp, author display, stable author hash, text, emotes/message id).
* **Aggregate windows** (start/end, msg count, unique authors, top tokens/emotes, sentiment).
* **Spike events** (time range, reason, strength).

4.2 The system **must** **delete raw messages** older than **90 days** (retain aggregates/spikes).
4.3 The system **should** apply a **soft cap** per stream (e.g., 200k raw messages) and continue storing aggregates when exceeded; the UI should inform the user.
4.4 The system **must** salt and store a **stable hashed author ID** per workspace for counting while limiting PII coupling.

**Acceptance:** After running a stream, data appears in history; a retention task can be verified to purge aged raw data while preserving aggregates.

## 5. Stream History & Detail

5.1 The system **must** list past streams with: title/date, duration, total messages, average sentiment, spike count.
5.2 The system **must** provide a **detail page** with a timeline and spike markers.
5.3 The system **must** allow **export** of aggregates and spikes to **CSV** and **JSON**.

**Acceptance:** A past stream shows accurate metrics and exports produce well-formed files that match displayed data.

## 6. Settings

6.1 The system **must** show workspace info (name), **region** (EU, read-only), and **retention** (90 days, read-only).
6.2 The system **must** display connected **Twitch integration** and a **Disconnect** action.
6.3 Language **must** be **English** for MVP.

**Acceptance:** Disconnect removes the integration and prevents further ingestion; reconnecting is possible.

## 7. Performance, Reliability, and UX

7.1 **Latency:** End-to-end metric latency **≤ 1.5s** under normal load.
7.2 **Resilience:** Temporary disconnects auto-recover without duplicate windows.
7.3 **Graceful degradation:** If sentiment fails temporarily, other KPIs continue to update; the UI surfaces a non-blocking notice.
7.4 **Accessibility:** Keyboard navigation and basic screen-reader labels for core controls (start/stop, navigation, exports).
7.5 **Responsiveness:** Desktop-first, **tablet-friendly** layout.

**Acceptance:** Load test at 100 msgs/sec for 10 minutes passes without data loss or UI lockups; sentiment failure simulation leaves rate/unique counters intact.

## 8. Security & Privacy

8.1 All app routes **must** require authentication.
8.2 All reads/writes **must** be scoped to the user’s workspace.
8.3 All network traffic **must** be over HTTPS; apply a sensible CSP.
8.4 Store only necessary fields (public display name + stable hash); provide a basic **workspace data export/delete** mechanism when feasible.
8.5 Use **read-only** chat permissions; no message posting or moderation actions.

**Acceptance:** Unauthorized requests are rejected; workspace isolation verified by attempting cross-workspace access (negative test).

# Bonus: Story Snippets in Gherkin (for QA)

**Spike detection**

* **Given** a live session and a stable baseline of message rate
* **When** the rate surges significantly for a minimum duration and volume
* **Then** the system flags a **spike** with timestamp and strength and surfaces it in the Events feed and timeline.

**Retention**

* **Given** raw chat older than 90 days
* **When** the retention job runs
* **Then** those raw messages are deleted while **aggregates and spikes remain** accessible.

**Reconnect**

* **Given** an active session
* **When** the chat connection drops unexpectedly
* **Then** the system retries with backoff and **resumes ingestion** without duplicating windows.

# Mini Acceptance Checklist

* [ ] Sign in → channel detected → lands on dashboard.
* [ ] Start listening → metrics update and spikes appear during surges.
* [ ] Stream saved in history → detail view shows timeline/spikes.
* [ ] Exports produce valid CSV/JSON.
* [ ] Raw older than 90 days is purged; aggregates remain.
* [ ] Disconnect Twitch stops ingestion; reconnect works.
* [ ] Latency feels ≤1.5s; reconnects recover without duplicates.

If you want it even shorter, I can compress this to a single-page checklist.
